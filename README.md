# Rusty Node.js REPL

## What?

A way run arbitrary code through Node.js from Rust.

## Why?

This is for **testing**. When working on Node.js related Rust projects it can allow you to co-locate JavaScript along side your Rust.

This crate came from implementing parts of the [Hypercore JS ecosystem](https://docs.pears.com/building-blocks/hypercore) where there is a need to test a Rust implementation against the JavaScript implementation.
